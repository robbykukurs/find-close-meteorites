# find-close-meteorites
Practice python script for finding close meteorites while doing A Cloud Guru Python course

In order to run this script, first you have to install pipenv - in order to avoid installing varius pythong modules individually, pipenv will do it for you!

Just run:

```
pipenv install

```

and then run the code using pipenv:

```
pipenv meteors/find-meteorites-within-200-miles.py

```
